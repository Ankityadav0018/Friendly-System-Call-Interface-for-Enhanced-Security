# Friendly-System-Call-Interface-for-Enhanced-Security

Overview
This project introduces a Friendly System Call Interface (FSCI) aimed at enhancing security, transparency, and ease of use when interacting with system calls in operating systems. It provides an abstraction layer over traditional system calls, offering a cleaner and more controlled mechanism for applications and developers.

Motivation
Traditional system call interfaces are often complex, low-level, and error-prone, increasing the attack surface of the operating system. This project proposes a user-friendly interface that simplifies usage and enforces secure patterns by design.

Key Features
âœ… High-level, human-readable system call wrappers

ðŸ”’ Built-in security checks for access control and parameter validation

ðŸ”§ Modular and extensible design

ðŸ“¦ Integration-ready for modern OS kernels

ðŸ“Š Logging and monitoring capabilities for audit trails

Architecture
The system architecture consists of the following components:

User Application

Invokes system functions through the FSCI rather than direct syscalls.

Friendly System Call Interface Layer

Parses, validates, and routes calls securely to the kernel interface.

Kernel Interface Adapter

Interfaces with the actual kernel-level system calls after security checks.

Logging & Monitoring Module

Tracks system calls, detects anomalies, and supports audit logging.

#include "fsci.h"

int fd = fsci_open("secure_file.txt", O_RDONLY);
fsci_read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
fsci_close(fd);
Security Highlights
Input Sanitization: All inputs to system calls are validated at the FSCI layer.

Least Privilege Access: Built-in mechanisms prevent unauthorized access.

Isolation: Interfaces can be sandboxed to reduce risk from compromised applications.

Monitoring Hooks: Real-time monitoring for suspicious behavior.
